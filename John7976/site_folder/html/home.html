The thing about me that most people find most fascinating is that I was adopted from China. When I was 10 months old, my Dad and Grandma flew all the way
across the world to adopt me and then when I was 4 years old, my Mom took a similar trip and adopted my younger sister (non-blood related) from a different city in China. When I
was 6 years old, I had my first piano lesson and since then have learned 12 more instruments and taken on singing. I was one of only a few musicians on Instagram that did covers
playing piano blindfolded before it became more popular a couple years later. I’ve thrown photography into the mix as well and love to stay close to home and catch nature’s “best
side”. The first website I ever made was actually my photography website, but I used a GUI editor where you only do the designing and the site is mostly pre-built and formatted. 
<br> <br>
Having absolutely no artistic skill when it comes to a pencil and paper, many would find it odd that I love the idea of designing websites; but when it comes to computers, my family
can admit they didn’t expect me anywhere else. When I was 8, I had my first “dream” of becoming a pharmacist. I was homeschooled for most of my K-8 grade years and being able to
work at my own fast pace made me feel like I could do anything. I could do the general studies and go out of my way to learn other things. I studied geology and astronomy and that
was something most kids didn’t get the opportunity to learn about. Since then, I decided against medicine in high school and moved on to wanting to major in musical performance.
Unfortunately, that wouldn’t get me anywhere financially and I decided to keep it as a hobby that I could enjoy whenever I wanted without it feeling like a responsibility. I found
that it was a lot better for my mental health when I recorded covers for me instead of for someone else or when trying to meet a specific deadline. After leaving my last job in the
print center of a Staples Store, I realized that I loved to create and design things (digital and print). I made custom business cards, posters, and flyers on the slow nights
instead of sending them to our professional design team, and the support of those highly satisfied customers alone helped me realize that I really wanted to learn more.

Since moving out when I was 19, my girlfriend and I have adopted a cat, 6 guinea pigs, 4 chickens, an axolotl, and a snail we found at the pumpkin farm. Our friends and family like
to say that we run a farm. Taking care of our family only leads to something about myself that I’m very proud of. Since my first job, and before, I’ve always had a great work ethic.
I love to work, I love overtime and I love to learn new things; but I have also seen the downside of focusing my energy into my job before myself. At one point, I was working 3 jobs,
60-85 hours a week and still wanting more. Most days at a new job, I’d find myself asking a thousand questions at first and then being one of the fastest and most efficient employees
by the end of the month. Although work is incredibly important to me, I always try to put my focus on things that I enjoy outside of my job.

Overall, I’d say that I’m a very determined girl with a big heart. I want everyone around me to see how hard I work and know that I wouldn’t change a thing. But more than anything,
I really think I could see my future self making websites and learning from the best in the business. Knowing how quickly computers and technology change, there’s always more to it
than just “the books”. Finding the little shortcuts and learning the ropes in general from someone who’s done it for longer is a great way to practice hands on and see what the
environment is actually like and not only how it’s depicted in books.
